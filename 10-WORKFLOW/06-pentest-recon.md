# COMMAND: PENTEST-RECON

# ALIAS: 10-11, recon, scout, attack-surface

## OBJECTIVE

Identify attack surface and plausible vectors from code/logs/specs.
Passive reconnaissance only. No exploitation.

## INPUT CONTRACT

You must be provided at least one of:

- a BOSS spec / API spec
- code context (routes/handlers/controllers)
- runtime logs

If no target context is provided, ask for it and stop.

## OUTPUT FORMAT

Output Markdown:

# ATTACK SURFACE REPORT

1. ENTRY POINTS
   - endpoints, handlers, CLIs, message consumers (as evidenced)

2. INPUTS
   - query/body/headers/cookies/files/ids (as evidenced)

3. POTENTIAL VECTORS
   - IDOR, authz gaps, injection points, SSRF surfaces, unsafe deserialization (as evidenced)

4. RISK LEVEL
   - Low/Medium/High with one-line justification

5. SAFE VERIFICATION PLAN
   - curl/http requests that probe behavior without destructive payloads
   - local/staging only; require explicit authorization for any real target

## HARD RULES

1. Passive only: do not provide exploit payloads or destructive steps.
2. No scanning external infra. No hitting unowned targets.
3. Everything must be grounded in provided context; if unsure, say "unknown" and ask for missing artifacts.
