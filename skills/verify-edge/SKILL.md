## OBJECTIVE

Expose trust-boundary I/O and prove the system fails closed under hostile or extreme inputs.

Standard suites assume cooperation. This skill assumes parsers, APIs, configs, and uploads are under attack or entropy.

## CORE RULE

A fuzz/edge pass that finds nothing and never fails a planted fault is inadequate detection — not proof of safety.

PASS requires:

- Targets limited to the highest-blast-radius surfaces (default ≤3).
- At least one harness with seed, budget, and shrink-on-fail.
- At least one discrimination check: a known-bad input or injected fault is rejected/handled without corruption.
- Findings classified by severity; Critical/High must be fixed or force claim narrowing.

## PROTOCOL

### Phase 1: Surface Selection (Budget)

Identify and rank surfaces by blast radius:

1. Parsers and deserializers at trust boundaries.
2. Auth/token/path/config merge inputs.
3. Public write APIs and file/path operations.
4. Multi-tenant or multi-agent shared state.

Pick the top ≤3 unless the user expands scope. Do not “fuzz everything.”

### Phase 2: Harness

Prefer repo-native property/fuzz tools (`fast-check`, `hypothesis`, `cargo fuzz`, `go test -fuzz`).

Each harness must record:

- Entry point and invariant (“never panic / never corrupt store / always DomainError”).
- Seed and time/iteration budget (default ≤5 minutes unless user sets otherwise).
- Shrink/minimize on failure — report the smallest failing input, not megabytes of noise.

### Phase 3: Fault Classes (Relevant Only)

Run only classes that apply to the surface:

| Class | Examples |
|-------|----------|
| Structural | empty, huge, truncated, wrong types |
| Boundary | MAX_INT±1, NaN, unicode/RTL, long strings |
| Injection | path escape, SQLi/command where inputs reach sinks |
| Merge/clobber | sibling-key preservation, hostile JSONC/YAML shapes |
| Resource | bounded large payload within local sandbox |

Do not paste an OWASP laundry list as evidence. Each executed class needs a command and result.

### Phase 4: Environment Chaos (Optional, Scoped)

When network/disk/memory claims exist, inject bounded faults in local/staging only:

- Latency / timeout of dependencies.
- Permission denied / missing file.
- Full disk only in disposable environments.

Chaos-test only the resolved target named by the task or live environment selection. Bound blast radius, define abort conditions, and verify rollback before injecting a production fault.

### Phase 5: Discrimination

Before PASS:

1. Plant or reuse one known-bad input that must be rejected.
2. Confirm the harness or suite fails open success (detects the bad case).
3. If the bad case is accepted or corrupts state → FAIL.

## OUTPUT FORMAT

```markdown
# EDGE / HOSTILE I/O REPORT

## Targets
- <surface>: why high blast radius

## Harnesses
- <name>: tool, seed, budget, invariant

## Results
- <case>: pass|fail — minimized input — severity

## Discrimination
- known-bad input: <desc> → rejected|ACCEPTED (ACCEPT = FAIL)

## Verdict
PASS|FAIL|BLOCKED
```

## HARD RULES

1. Budget first — max 3 surfaces by default.
2. Capture seeds; shrink failures.
3. Contain blast radius (local/staging/containers).
4. No pass from “ran fuzz for N minutes” without invariants and discrimination.
5. Hand suite-wide oracle quality to `verify-coverage`; hand shipped journeys to `verify-prove`.
